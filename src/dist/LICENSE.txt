Historical notes
----------------

FreeMarker 1.x was released under the LGPL license. Later, by
community consensus, we have switched over to a BSD-style license. As
of FreeMarker 2.2pre1, the original author, Benjamin Geer, has
relinquished the copyright in behalf of Visigoth Software Society.

With FreeMarker 2.3.21 the license has changed to Apache License,
Version 2.0, and the owner has changed from Visigoth Software Society
to three of the FreeMarker 2.x developers, Attila Szegedi, Daniel
Dekany, and Jonathan Revusky.
